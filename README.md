#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### 1. GOAL
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>


Here are the data for the project:
<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

For this project we create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### 2. Repository Contents
Files in this project:

- *README.md* : this file, a general description of the project

- *README.hml* : the html version of *README.md*

- *CodeBook.md* : the CodeBook reference to the variables in *Tidy.txt*

- *CodeBook.html* : the html version of *CodeBook.md*

- *run_analysis.R* : the R script that performs the requered transformations over 
<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip> to transform it into *Tidy.txt*

- *run_analysis.html* : the html generated by runnig "kinit" over *run_analysis.R*, it shows validation outputs for each requiered steps of the script 

- *Tidy.txt* : the tidy summary data extracted from the original data using *run_analysis.R*
